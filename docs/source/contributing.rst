How to contribute changes to this repository
---

- Open a `Pull Request <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/empiarreader/pulls>`_.

- Our basic workflow is `GitHub flow <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow>`_.  In particular:
  - The branch `main` always contain the latest working version of the package.
  - Pull Requests should normally have `main` as their base branch (this is the default).
  - A Pull Request doesn't have to represent finished work. Pull Requests are welcome at an early stage of work on a contribution, so others can watch or give feedback, or as a place to discuss the work in progress---you can always add more commits to the same branch later, and they will be included too. If it is not ready to merge, include "WIP" (Work in Progress) in the subject line, or select "Create Draft Pull Request" when opening it.
  - For a Pull Request to be ready to merge:
    - All of the automated tests should pass
    - It should add tests of any new functionality
  - A code review can be requested at any time
  - Pull requests are `squash merged <https://github.blog/2016-04-01-squash-your-commits/>`_` to `main`
